 * headers, etc), but is here mostly to be expanded in implementations.
 * <p/>
 * For instance, adding an authenticated User doing the request would be useful when determining
 * if said user has access to secure content - proving the security filter with whatever input
 * required to match authorisation to authentication supplied by a controller.

 * Extend from the Base Processor to have your Factory Items
 * Post processed. There are three options when a processor can run:
 * - Before the item is cached in the DD4T object cache
 * - After the item is cached in the DD4T object cache (this means every time).
 * - On both occassions, which should happen rarely.
 * <p/>
 * Note: running processors after fetching an item from cache is
 * perfectly fine, but in case of expensive operations, be sure to
 * use additional caching (like output caching in a web application) to
 * cache final output. Even so, as most processors tends to run here, this
 * is the default phase.
